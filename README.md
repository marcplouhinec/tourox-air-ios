Tourox Air for iOS
==================

Tired of raising your voice when talking to your tourist group? Tourox Air is a smart voice
assistant created with the tour guide in mind! Tourox Air lets the visitors use their own mobile
phones to listen to the guide's voice. No need to carry around multiple audio devices!

Please note that this application only works when connected via WiFi to the tour guide's device.

If you are a professional working in the tourism industry and are interested in buying or selling
